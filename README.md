# fund-my-watcard

This is a convenient tool to fund the watcard. I am too lazy to fund it by hand, so I write this tool.

## install package

```bash
pip install fund-my-watcard
```

## usage

```bash
# gengerate the config file
watcard --config

# fund your WatCard with $10
watcard --fund 10
```

## TODO

- Docker support
- Check the balance automatically
- More robust
